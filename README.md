Open source molecular dynamics analysis tools for GROMACS

I am a doctoral candidate in chemical engineering at the University of Louisville. Prior to starting the Ph.D. work I had practiced as a control systems engineer in the petrochemical industry for over 30 years. I have professional engineering licenses in chemical (1985) and electrical (1988) engineering. I will graduate May 9, 2020.

Primarily my research is simulation of biophysical processes related to membranes, membrane proteins and the role of the electric field in establishing equilibrium membrane/protein structures and the modulation of membrane protein channel transport.
