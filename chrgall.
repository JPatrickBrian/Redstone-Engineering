#            ### examine (0 or 1) will remain a manual choice, possibly always since    ###
#            ### the computational cost is so high for even 1 pore. This more capable   ###

# parameters
# $1         number of vertical bins
#   options: typically 50 or 100
# $2         awk routine to execute
#   options: 3dchrg4[AHNPWSCRTYL].awk
# $3         atom charge file for this version of simulation topology
#   options: whatever you have named your charge file
# $4         output file name
# $5         pore channel number to process
#   options: 0 or 1
# $6         number of alpha bath ions of each species
#   explain: if alpha bath has 11 +tive and 11 -tive ions, (always neutral) enter 11
# $7         number of beta bath ions of each species
